# Digitalizing ECG
Starting from an image of an ECG done with a scanner, this project is about to get the digital signal.
We can find three types of images:
<ol>
<li> Those with the grid in a diferent color from the signal:

<li> Those in gray scale but with the signal clearly marked:

<li> Those in gray scale but the signal can be confused with grid (to computational vision):
